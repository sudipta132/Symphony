                Overwhelming Schedule<br>
                Problem: Trying to fit too many tasks into a limited time can be overwhelming. Solution: Prioritize tasks and break them into smaller, manageable chunks. Use a planner or app to spread tasks out over a realistic timeline. <br>

                Lack of Flexibility<br>
                Problem: Rigid schedules can lead to stress and frustration when unexpected events occur. Solution: Build in buffer times for breaks and unexpected delays. Allow some flexibility in your schedule to adapt to changes.<br>
                <br>
                Procrastination: <br>
                Problem: Delaying tasks can disrupt your timetable and cause stress. Solution: Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break) to maintain focus and prevent procrastination.<br>
